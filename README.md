# gauss-kruger-python-pt


Computational method for Transverse Mercator: 
That is, how to convert between latitude/longitude and projected coordinates, and vice versa. 
There is no simple closed formula to do so when the earth is modelled as an ellipsoid.

Natural origin is hard-coded inside the Gauss-Kruger projection functions. 

Used, with a different natural origin and a different ellipsoid (GRS-80), by:
